REQS:

	* NO MAKEFILE
	* NO LEAKS
	* WE ARE ALLOWED READ, MALLOC && FREE FROM LIBC

TECH DESC:

	* FUNCTION MUST RETURN A LINE READ FROM FD
	* LINE IS SUCCESION OF CHARACTERS THAT END WITH NEWLINE OR EOF
	* FIRST PARAM IS THE FD THAT WE WILL READ FROM
	* SECOND PARAM IS THE ADDR OF A POINTER  TO A CHAR ARRAY THAT WILL BE USED TO SAVE THE LINE

	* RETURN VALUES:
		1 == LINE HAS BEEN READ
		0 == READING COMPLETE
		-1 == ERROR

* MUST RETURN RESULT WITHOUT NEWLINES
* MUST READ FROM FILE, STDIN, ETC.

OPTIONAL:

	* ABLE TO READ BINARY FILES

BONUS:
	* USE A SINGLE STATIC VARIABLE
	* ABLE TO READ/MANAGE MULTIPLE FDâ€™S (READ WITHOUT LOSING THREAD ON EACH FD)

Protect against overflowing line.
Don't use a static size for line.
Make get_next_line grow line as needed.
Let the caller know how large line is (like getline does).
